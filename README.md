**Machine Learning Blogs**
=====================================

I have started making these blogs for those who want to learn more about Machine Learning. These blogs will contain in depth explanation on certain basic agorithms to get started off. Later I shall start adding specific models that I think can be used in a lot of applications and has a lot of potential. 


*Note: I might also add a few other blogs about projects I am working on in ML and also on technologies that are making a lot of buzz*
